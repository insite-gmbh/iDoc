# iDoc
Documentation of insite tools



Create a documentation page like [this](https://dotnetfoundation.org/net-core).
I think we should use [docFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) for this and work like the [seed project](https://github.com/docascode/docfx-seed)

[howto](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx.exe_user_manual.html) -> geting started 
[create custom template](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/howto_create_custom_template.html) -> give the page an insite touch.


- [ ] All files should be *.md files like in the seed project. ()
- [ ] For the tools you should use the generated md files from our documentation project.


the menu should look like 
|HOME|PROJECTS|GET INVOLVED|ABOUT|

in Projects we should inlude:
Project1:
  documentation
  release notes
Project2:
  documentation
  release notes
...


GET INVOLVED:
decribes how other people could update our documentation (if we are ready we make the repo public)

Other samples:
* [VSCode Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
